I think I first want a nice backend and a nice frontend. I want fo first decide the features I want to include in the app, this will determine the database schema that we w ill use and then I will decide which type of backend I want or serverless. I think we need to focus soleely on building the essential aprts of the system with good monitoring and observability , like integration with opensource tools like graphana or just using our own logging tools.

ok lets start off with what we know and how we know it.

let's not over the top complicate it and put aout too many tables, lets only put tables that are essential and then we can add more as we go along. Atleast thats what I am thinking for now.
